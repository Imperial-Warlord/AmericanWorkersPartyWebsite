		America is a nation founded on numerous principles, but perhaps the chief among them is that “All Men Are Created Equal”. Yet it has become abundantly clear in recent times that this is not the sentiment held by America’s politicians and financial elites. The Worker, they demand, must work themselves, possibly to death, in the factories and packing plants in unsafe conditions, and for no more compensation than what they previously were given. The Middle- and Upper-Middle-Class, thanks to an innate feeling of entitlement brought about by years of enjoying their wealth in comfort at the expense of the Worker, are just as indignant.  It is clear to any observer with a functioning pair of eyes and half of a brain that America is not the Land of the Free, nor are those who live within it Equal.

		To look upon the United States and say that the American people are ruled by an American government is nonsensical. Wall Street and Big Business own every American politician at every level of influence, from the Presidency to Congress to the Supreme Court. To believe that the establishment will ever do anything that is truly in the interest of the Average American, let alone anything that is truly in the interest of the Worker, is insanity. It is childish nonsense to say that an American government rules America- it’s nothing to do with the American government or the American people! The government of the World is the Financial Government- the Power of Money, and of Money Alone!
		</p><p>
		The Government is often seen either as a “necessary evil” or an “unnecessary burden”. This is not truly the case- it is propaganda engineered by the Elites to prevent the Worker from seeing the true power of the Government and using it for themselves to break the stranglehold of the Power of Money. The Government is the most powerful tool at the Workers’ disposal, but they are kept from taking the reigns of the Government by the Middle- and Upper-Middle-Class, who are kept either in fear of the Government or in firm opposition to it by propaganda manufactured by the Elites. The Elites also conspire to ensure that as few Workers as possible can exercise their power at the voting booth through laws ostensibly meant to “prevent voter fraud”. The Elites are constantly in fear of the Workers becoming aware, and they fear even more what would happen if the Workers were able to exercise their Will through the Government. That is exactly why the Government must be taken by the Workers- exactly because it is what the Elites fear.

		You will not agree with us if you are content with things as they are. But, you will at least hear us with sympathy if you, like we, believe that Government by Talk, must, at last, give way to Government by Action. We are the American Workers’ Party, and we will do everything we feasibly can in order to make the American Government to be Of the Worker, By the Worker, and For the Worker, and to at last make it to where All Workingmen Are Equal.
